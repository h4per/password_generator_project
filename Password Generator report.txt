Description: 
This is a Java-based password generator that allows users to create strong passwords based on their preferences. The program provides three main options for generating passwords:
1. Custom Password Generation – Users can specify password length and character types (uppercase, lowercase, digits, special symbols).
2. Preset-Based Password Generation – Users can select from predefined character sets.
3. Completely Random Password Generation – A fully randomized password using all available character sets.
Additionally, the program integrates the zxcvbn password strength estimator to evaluate the security of generated passwords.

Challenges encountered:
While working on project, the most hard part was to properly integrate the zxcvbn library and some minor code interactions.

Conclusion:
For this code to work, I read some articles about using random methods in Java, several GitHub repositories and their documentation.
